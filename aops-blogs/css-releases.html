      <h1>Overview</h1>
      The Art of Problem Solving website provides a platform in which users can create their own blogs and whatever content they want on it. These blogs also provide a box in which users can customize the CSS of the blog, and thus personalize how the blog's appearance looks.
      <br><br>
      It's sort of become a custom for people to release blog CSS's that they've created and want to share on the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c66_aops_blogs_discussions" target="_blank">AoPS Blogs Discussion forum</a>. I wanted to have a coherent and easy way to access all of the CSS's that I've released in the past, so here they are!
      
      <h1>Usage Instructions</h1>
      First, choose which CSS you want. You can look at roughly how the CSS will look by clicking on the link in the respective "Display Blog" column of the table below. Keep in mind whether you want the CSS to be mobile friendly or other similar perks.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, choose whether you want to use the import URL or the raw CSS. The import URL comes with the perk of not having to change the CSS in your individual blog every time I update the CSS, as every time I push out a change, the file will change and thus your blog will also update. However, the raw CSS allows much easier editing of the CSS file if you want to have the option to change the CSS to fit your own personal preferences. I personally recommend using the import URL over the raw CSS, as it's just much easier, but it's up to you.
      <br><br>
      After choosing which CSS file you want, simply scroll down to the table and click on the link in the respective row and column. For example, if you wanted to use the import URL for Infinity.css, you would click on the link in the "Import URL" column in the "Infinity.css" row.
      <br><br>
      Then, copy all of the text inside of that file, by pressing ctrl-a or cmd-a depending on whether you're on PC or Mac, and then ctrl-c or cmd-c. Then simply go into your own blog's Custom CSS box (you can find this by clicking on "Blog Info" on the top right corner of your blog and scrolling down) and pasting the code into it through either ctrl-v or cmd-v.
      <br><br>
      When using my CSS, please do not remove either the commented header at the top of the CSS or the pseudoelement after the blog that says it was created by me. Thank you!
