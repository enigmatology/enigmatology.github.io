How do I make graphs like this?, you may ask. The answer: Asymptote, a vector graphics language that allows you to draw neat geometry diagrams in your proof. This blog is going to be a blog where I post lessons for beginners. If you don't know a single thing about Asymptote, that's OK! I'm going to be starting with the basics.

Additionally, at the end of every lesson, there are going to be a couple practice problems with the solutions. If you find yourself needing more practice, you can just try out those problems.

Let's get started!
