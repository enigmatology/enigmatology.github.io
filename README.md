A blog including in-progress tutorials for Asymptote and CSS, as well as a simple overall blog. Also includes other projects such as a mock competition online testing software to practice AMCs.

## Asymptote Tutorials
Asymptote is a unique and powerful vector graphics programming language that allows you to make advanced graphics. Upon finding very limited resources to learn how to use the language, I decided to create my own. In this tutorial, I teach how to make simple diagrams for geometry problems using Asymptote, from the ground up.

## CSS Tutorials
AoPS Blogs are a big thing on the Art of Problem Solving website. However, learning to code your own CSS for your blog can seem daunting at first. I teach how to use CSS to style an AoPS Blog in this tutorial.

## Other Resources
* Online mock competition software: online client-side software that allows you to practice mock AMCs online, free. Intended to simulate the AoPS/MAA official testing software so you can fully mock the competition environment.
* AoPS Blog CSS release page: free list of AoPS blog CSSs that I've coded.
