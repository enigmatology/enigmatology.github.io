## Asymptote Tutorials
Asymptote is a unique and powerful vector graphics programming language that allows you to make advanced graphics. Upon finding very limited resources to learn how to use the language, I decided to create my own, to teach how to make simple diagrams for geometry problems using Asymptote.

## Mock Competition Software
Online (mostly) client-side software that allows you to practice mock AMCs online, free. It is intended to simulate the AoPS/MAA official testing software so you can fully mock the competition environment. Results save if you are logged in, so you can view scores and answer choices for past mock contests.
