<!---- I had to change all of the languages to Java because making them Asymptote was causing strange behavior and Java syntax is at least somewhat similar to Asymptote ---->

[b]The dir() Function.[/b] The dir() function is a very useful function that allows you to draw points using angles rather than coordinates. The dir() function essentially uses a polar coordinate system: if you look at this diagram, you'll see a preview of how it works:

The dir() function creates a point that is of a certain angle counterclockwise from the point (1, 0) of distance 1 from the origin. The syntax is as follows:
[code=java]dir(direction);[/code]
where the direction is measured in degrees. For example,
[code=java]
// the lines draw the axis, so they don't affect the dir
// ignore the lines with the backslashes, they're called comments
draw((-2, 0)--(2, 0));
draw((0, -2)--(0, 2));
dot(dir(50));[/code]
creates

As you can see, the dot created is 50 degrees counterclockwise of the x-axis. This is particularly useful when creating triangles with certain angle measures.

Note that you can also able to put negative angle measures in the argument of the dir() function, which will measure the angle clockwise rather than counterclockwise.

The dir() function comes as a pair:
[code=java]pair variableName = dir(direction);[/code]

If you want the length of your function to be longer or shorter than just 1 unit, you can multiply your dir() function by a number, such as this:
[code=java]pair point = sqrt(2)*dir(50);[/code]

Problem 1: Draw a dot that is 37 degrees counter-clockwise from the origin. [hide=Solution]
Code:
[code=java]dot(dir(37));[/code]
Result:
