The above graph was created with Asymptote, a vector graphics language that allows you to draw neat geometry diagrams. This blog will contain tutorials that teach the very basics of drawing diagrams with Asymptote. Please note that Asymptote goes much deeper than what is taught here, and this blog contains only the tip of the iceberg.

At the end of every lesson, there are going to be some simple practice problems with the solutions. If you find yourself needing more practice, you can try out those problems.
