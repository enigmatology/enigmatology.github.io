[i]Creating and Using Variables[/i][/center]

In Asymptote, it's quite handy to name variables, whether it's for a value, for a point, or for a path. This is useful because you may need to use a point many times: with variables, instead of needing to type the coordinates every single time, you can just create a variable once and use the variable instead.

To create a variable, use the following syntax.
[code=asymptote]variableType variableName = variableValue;[/code]

[b]Variable type:[/b] When creating a variable, Asymptote needs to know what kind of variable you're creating - for example, four common types in Asymptote are [b]ints[/b], [b]reals[/b], [b]pairs[/b], and [b]paths[/b].

The variable name is the name of the variable you're creating. This is effectively it's identifier - just as we identify each other by our names, Asymptote identifies variables by their names. Note that variable names cannot contain spaces.

The variable value is what is being stored inside that value, which you retrieve by referring to its name.

[b][u]Creating Variables[/u][/b]
[b]Ints.[/b] Int stands for integer - this variable type can contain any integer, such as 5, -2, or 18430. Specifically, here is this syntax to create an int:
[code=asymptote]int variableName = integerValue;[/code]
The variableName is what you want to call this variable - try to call it something that makes sense. For example, if it's the x-coordinate of a point, you may want to call it x_coor.

[b]Reals.[/b] Reals contain any real number (such as -0.1 or 3.1415). Just like ints, the syntax is as follows:
[code=asymptote]real variableName = numberValue;[/code]

[b]Pairs.[/b] A pair is a data type that stores a coordinate pair.
[code=asymptote]pair variableName = (xCoord, yCoord);[/code]
Note that you must use parenthesis around your variable value.

[b]Paths.[/b] A path is a drawing, such as a line or circle.
[code=asymptote]path variableName = variableValue;[/code]
For example, to create a variable containing a circle, you would use
[code=asymptote]path circle = circle((center_x, center_y), radius);[/code]
To create a line,
[code=asymptote]path line = (x_1, y_1) -- (x_2, y_2);[/code]

To create multiple variables of the same type in the same line, use:
[code=asymptote]variableType name1 = value1, name2 = value2, name3 = value3;[/code]
where name1, name2, and name3 are the names of the variables and value1, value2, and value3 are the values of the variables respectively (you can create more or less than just 3 variables in one line).

[b][u]Using Created Variables[/u][/b]
To use a variable that you previously populated, use the name of the variable. For example:
[code=asymptote]pair center = (0, 0);
int radius = 5;
path circle = circle(center, radius);
draw(circle);
dot(center);[/code]
which would give you [hide=this]

[b][u]Practice Problems[/u][/b]
Problem 1: Create a variable of type int with name radius and value 5, and draw a dot using that variable at (radius, radius). [hide=Solution]
Code:
[code=asymptote]int radius = 5;
dot((radius, radius));[/code]
Result:

Problem 2: Create 2 pairs in one line: one with coordinates (1, 2) and the other with coordinates (3, 1). Draw a line between those two points with the variables. [hide=Solution]
Code:
[code=asymptote]pair point1 = (1, 2), point2 = (3, 1);
draw(point1--point2);[/code]
Result:

Problem 3: Create a variable of type path that contains a circle with center (4, 1) and radius 2. Draw that circle. [hide=Solution]
Code:
[code=asymptote]path circle = circle((4, 1), 2);
draw(circle);[/code]
Result:
