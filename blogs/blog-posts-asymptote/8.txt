[i]The Olympiad.asy Package[/i][/center]

In my opinion, the Olympiad.asy package contains some of the most important functions inside of Asymptote. First, we need to define what a package is.

If you've used pretty much any other coding language, you'll be familiar with what a package is. It's what you'd put in the import line at the top of your Python program, for example. A package is effectively a set of functions that can be used that don't automatically come with Asymptote - if you download Asymptote on your own computer, you'll have to separately download this package as well. AoPS handily comes with the Olympiad.asy package, though, so you don't need to do anything extra to use it on AoPS.

The Olympiad.asy package contains more functions that can be used to find points or paths without actually finding the coordinates of it. I'm just going to write out a list of all of the functions, as that's the easiest way to describe them.

[b][u](Incomplete) List of Olympiad.asy Functions[/u][/b]
[b]Generic Functions[/b]
<ul>
<li>[b]origin[/b] returns the pair $(0, 0)$. [hide=Example of origin]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/6/7/3670ab4f3d6c432735d35a3c162e0b2ba21275c2.png"/>[/hide]</li>
<li>[b]foot(X, A, B)[/b] where $A$, $B$, and $X$ are pairs returns the foot of the altitude from $X$ to line $AB$. [hide=Example of foot]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/e/9/d/e9d80bac9767a3391020956d80a6ff7aa9fb99b8.png"/>[/hide]</li>
<li>[b]midpoint(A--B)[/b] where $A$ and $B$ are pairs returns the midpoint of the segment $AB$. Note the two dashes between $A$ and $B$ instead of a comma. [hide=Example of midpoint]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/8/d/c/8dcd0c4aa6434526dcd5f70e0ea1b4e45d59c05f.png"/>[/hide]</li>
</ul>

[b]Intersections of Paths[/b]
<ul>
<li>[b]extension(A, B, C, D)[/b] where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are pairs returns the point of the intersection of the lines $AB$ and $CD$.[hide=Example of extension]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/b/0/d/b0d31eb8645680198c17cef6d362e4614ba5eeb8.png"/>[/hide]</li>
<li>[b]intersectionpoint(A, B)[/b] where $A$ and $B$ are paths returns the intersection of the paths $A$ and $B$ (similar to the extension function). NOTE: Unlike the extension function, [b]this will throw an error if the paths do not intersect[/b]. Thus, if you're trying to intersect a segment and a circle that don't intersect, you won't get anything - you need to first find a point on that line farther than the other two and use that instead of the first one. NOTE2: If the paths $A$ and $B$ intersect at more than one point, this function will throw an error, and instead you should use the function in the next bullet point. If you're finding the intersection of two lines, it is better to use the first bullet point's function.[hide=Example of intersectionpoint]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/5/9/1/591b969a911bd68469f9d01cfdac671099a7e053.png"/>[/hide]</li>
<li>[b]intersectionpoints(A, B)[x][/b] where $A$ and $B$ are paths and x is an integer returns the $x+1$th intersection counter-clockwise of the paths $A$ and $B$. NOTE: Unlike the extension function, [b]this will throw an error if the paths do not intersect[/b]. Thus, if you're trying to intersect a segment and a circle that don't intersect, you won't get anything - you need to first find a point on that line farther than the other two and use that instead of the first one. NOTE2: If the paths $A$ and $B$ intersect only once, it is better to use the second bullet point's function.

</ul>

[b]Special Points of a Triangle[/b]
<ul>
<li>[b]circumcenter(A, B, C)[/b] where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are pairs returns the circumcenter of the triangle $ABC$. [hide=Example of circumcenter]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/2/3/7/23710800ee28f831ae3f080d4d2596e0ea176cb0.png"/>[/hide]</li>
<li>[b]incenter(A, B, C)[/b] where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are pairs returns the incenter of the triangle $ABC$. [hide=Example of incenter]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/f/7/f/f7feafc62d325cba6b6450572a4e9ed1168f0a79.png"/>[/hide]</li>
<li>[b]orthocenter(A, B, C)[/b] where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are pairs returns the orthocenter of the triangle $ABC$. [hide=Example of orthocenter]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/3/3/6/3369bf8dbb4392572fcf206e0d60b9ca425924c2.png"/>[/hide]</li>
<li>[b]centroid(A, B, C)[/b] where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are pairs returns the centroid of the triangle $ABC$. [hide=Example of centroid]<img src="https://latex.artofproblemsolving.com/4/f/a/4faaa14f9ef0186b3b8f30ecd34b5cd058c8b2fe.png"/>[/hide]</li>

[b][u]Practice Problems[/u][/b]
No practice problems for this lesson (as this was more of a functional lesson).
