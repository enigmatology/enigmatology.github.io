First, we will understand how Asymptote works. Asymptote draws using the [b]Cartesian Coordinate System[/b]: there are two perpendicular axis with the origin in the middle, and every step you take in the right/left direction you increment the x value by $1$, and every step you take in the up/down direction you increment the y direction by $1$. In order to draw a diagram, you will always need to know the coordinates of your points, whether they are hard-coded or programmatically found.

Here are a few recommendations to run Asymptote:
<ul>
<li> Install Asymptote. You can find instructions on how to do this at the <a href="https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/" target="_blank">official Asymptote website</a>.
<li> The <a href="http://asymptote.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">official online Asymptote editor</a>.
<li> The AoPS <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer" target="_blank">LaTeX TeXeR</a>. In the TeXeR, input Asymptote code enclosed in [asy][/asy] tags, and press "RENDER WITH BBCODE."
</ul>

Next lesson, we'll get into the drawing.
