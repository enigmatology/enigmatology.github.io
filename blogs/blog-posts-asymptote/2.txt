Before we can start coding, we need to first understand how Asymptote works. Asymptote draws using the [b]Cartesian Coordinate System[/b]. If you've taken a relatively simple geometry class, you'll know what this is: essentially there are two perpendicular axis with the origin in the middle, and every step you take in the right/left direction you increment the x value by $1$, and every step you take in the up/down direction you increment the y direction by $1$.

To draw, you'll need to know the coordinates of the basic points. As you get better at Asymptote, you'll learn more techniques such as dir and intersection and extension, but as of now, we'll stick to the points that require the knowledge of all coordinates.

When testing Asymptote code, I recommend a couple resources. First, the <a href="https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a> website makes it incredibly easy to just input and test Asymptote code. In the site, you can try Asymptote in posts, or you can go to the free resource called the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer" target="_blank">TeXeR</a>. In the TeXeR, simply input your Asymptote code enclosed in [asy][/asy] tags, and press "RENDER WITH BBCODE." Finally, the <a href="http://asymptote.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">Official Asymptote Editor</a> is quite good as well.

So that's the introduction and the end of this lesson. Next lesson, we'll get into the drawing.
