[i]Customization I: Labelling Points[/i][/center]

When coding in Asymptote, it's sometimes helpful to label a point or color a path or label. Asymptote has the ability to do either of those things, using special arguments and/or commands inside of a function.

[b][u]Labeling Pairs and Paths[/u][/b]
There are two main ways to label something. The first is to label it while creating the pair/path itself, the other is to label it afterwards.

[b]Labelling while creating.[/b] To label a pair or a path while creating the pair/path itself, simply add another argument in front of all of the arguments of the draw function. The syntax looks like this:
[code=asymptote]draw("label", item);[/code]
Notice the quotes around the label - these indicate that the label is a [b]string[/b], a data type containing a sequence of characters.

If you wanted to label a point as $A$, you would do this:
[code=asymptote]dot("$A$", (0, 0))[/code]
Notice that you need dollar signs around the A just as in $\LaTeX$.

This will look like this:

Notice what happens we draw another line, as follows:

The line can go straight through the label. To fix this, add another argument. This argument will tell Asymptote where to draw the label relative to your new point.
[code=asymptote]draw("label", item, direction);[/code]
To specify the direction of the label, use the [code=asymptote]dir()[/code] function. In the following example, we will use [code=asymptote]dir(180)[/code] to make the label appear directly left of the point.

[b]Labelling afterwards.[/b] This is very similar to labelling while creating. SImply use the label command after creating the object:
[code=asymptote]draw(item);
label("label", item, direction);[/code]
[b][u]Practice Problems[/u][/b]
1. Label the point (0, 0) as point $A$ upwards directly while drawing. [hide=Solution]
Code:
[code=asymptote]
dot("$A$", (0, 0), dir(90));
[/code]
Result:

[/hide]
2. Label the point (0, 0) as point $A$ to the right and down after drawing. [hide=Solution]
Code:
[code=asymptote]
dot((0, 0));
label("$A$", (0, 0), dir(315));
[/code]
Result:
