Reflections

May 22, 2021

I suppose I'll post some reflections, because why not. The AP Computer Science A test was on Tuesday! I think it went quite well, although the FRQs were a bit oddly hard relative to the practice tests that I'd been doing before it. It seems like it was just me, though, so I'm not certain about that. Other than that, my timing for the MCQs was basically perfect and I still finished the FRQs roughly 10 minutes early or something, but I didn't really know what else to do so I just submitted. Perhaps I would've gone back and checked number 1 or 2 or something but this year CollegeBoard doesn't let you go back so there wasn't a way for me to do it, and I'd already checked number 4 a couple times so there wasn't really a point in checking it again.

I started doing some auth stuff again because I can use JS again, as you can see on the top right corner. It's going surprisingly well, but I unfortunately found out that the server I'm using doesn't let you do backend coding for free so I might need to look into somethig else. Hopefully it won't be too difficult.

I have AP World History: Modern on June 3, which I'm kind of terrified for. I'm not really the best at writing so I need to practice a bunch, and it's been going alright, but I've also found that I have a bunch of holes in literally just knowing history, so I'm also doing a bunch of memorization. Hopefully it works, there's less than 2 weeks until the test so yeah.

I guess I'll just say some small stuff to just add some more content xD I have an orthodontist appointment on Wednesday and I'm hoping that I'll get all of my braces out (I already have all of my bottom brackets out so now I'm just waiting on the top). If I do, that means that I'll be getting a retainer, which is fun.

See you next post, then :)
