    	<h1>About Me</h1>
    	I'm currently a sophomore in high school in the US. I initially learned Asymptote to write some proofs for a class on the Art of Problem Solving website, and I've enjoyed messing around with the diagrams and making them look nice ever since.
        <br><br>
        I ended up writing tutorials because I noticed that although a lot of people want to learn Asymptote, there weren't necessarily the resources out there to learn the language. I initially started writing the tutorials on an AoPS blog (see <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c1205320" target="_blank">here</a>) and I eventually decided that I should move it to a separate site, so here we are!
        
      <h1>Why "enigmatology?"</h1>
        To be honest, no particular reason. I just decided to use the word because it's semi-related to the content of the blog (I suppose like math-y and computer science-y) and it's just a cool word.
        
        In case you're curious, it's a noun meaning "the study of puzzles."
