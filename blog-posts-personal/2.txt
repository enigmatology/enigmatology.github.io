Dynamic Content with MathJax

May 9, 2021

I'm very confused right now. I've been putting of messing around with MathJax to render math on my blogposts, but this entire time, it was literally just a simple
[code=javascript]
MathJax.typeset();
[/code]
call. Why was I confused again?

Well then, it should work now:
\[\int_0^\infty {\frac{1}{x^2}\,dx}\],
so that's a plus :D
