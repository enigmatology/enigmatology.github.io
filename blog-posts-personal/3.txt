Life Update, pt. 1

May 16, 2021

I suppose I should start posting content here that's not just coding-related because this is, after all, a personal blog. However, I can't refrain from complaining about some coding thing, so I'll do that first xD

Authentication is hard. Even simpler services that do all of the heavy lifting for you make it difficult. The docs aren't easily discernable and aren't always that easy to alter to fit your needs, so I often find myself just trying stuff until it works. At least StackOverflow exists :D StackOverflow is effectively the Wikipedia of coding-related knowledge.

Anyways, I haven't been working on auth for a while because I'm trying to refrain from using JS for now, because I have APCSA on Tuesday! Hopefully shouldn't be terribly difficult, but I still don't want to be accidentally going
[code=javascript]
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
[/code]
instead of
[code=java]
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
[/code]
and bleed easy points. I'm hoping that I'll be able to make progress after that but no promises because AP World has been a mess so far.

Speaking of AP World, that's happening on June 3rd. MCQs are hard but hopefully studying over these three weeks will at least pull my score up far enough to be roughly in the range of a 5. I still need to make sure I don't mess up on the writing, though, which also isn't particularly easy.

Vaccines recently got approved for my age range, which is a plus! I'll probably wait until AP tests are over until I get it, though, just in case ~side effects~ are a thing so I don't feel feverish or anything during the test.

School's already ending in roughly a month, which is insane, because it feels like both high school hasn't even started yet and it should already be over. Still excited for the summer, although I'm not certain how I'll feel about it once we actually get there. I always feel like that every year, lol.

Yeah, that's basically all that's been happening lately. See you in the next post :)
